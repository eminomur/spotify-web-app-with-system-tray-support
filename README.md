Spotify Web App but can be minimised to system tray

I decided developing this toy program because I needed a Spotify application which can be minimised to system tray
when close button is clicked. I will test it on Manjaro with KDE.
Note: To make it work properly chromium-widevine is needed.

Feel free to inform me if some parts need some improvements.
